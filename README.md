# amazon-sales-dashboard-powerbi
This project is an interactive Amazon sales analysis dashboard built using Power BI, designed to provide a clear and concise overview of key performance metrics. The goal was to help stakeholders monitor business performance, track product engagement, and identify trends over time.

The dashboard highlights four primary KPIs:

YTD Sales (Year-to-Date)

QTD Sales (Quarter-to-Date)

YTD Products Sold

YTD Reviews

To offer multiple perspectives on the data, the report includes a variety of visualizations:

Sales by Month and Sales by Week to track overall trends and seasonal patterns

Sales by Category to compare product category performance

Top 5 Products by YTD Sales to identify best-sellers

Top 5 Products by YTD Reviews to show customer engagement

Data transformation and modeling were handled within Power BI using Power Query and DAX formulas to ensure accurate time-based calculations and smooth user interactivity.

This project showcases my ability to turn raw sales data into a story-driven dashboard, focusing on clean design and actionable insights. It can be used by sales teams, category managers, or executives to quickly identify performance drivers and make data-informed decisions.
